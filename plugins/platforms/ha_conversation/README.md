# Home Assistant Conversation Agent platform plugin

This plugin registers Hermes as a **conversation agent** inside Home
Assistant's Assist pipeline, using the Wyoming `handle` protocol. HA keeps
owning wake word, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech on its existing voice
hardware (ESPHome devices like the Voice PE, S3-BOX, the HA companion app's
Assist); Hermes only receives the transcript and produces the reply text.

This **complements, not replaces**, the `voice_satellite` platform:
`voice_satellite` makes Hermes *behave like* a satellite/wake-word device
talking directly to HA's Assist pipeline (Hermes-initiated), while
`ha_conversation` makes Hermes the *conversation agent* HA calls into
(HA-initiated, per utterance). It also composes with the `homeassistant`
event-monitor/toolset — this plugin only answers utterances; entity control
during a turn goes through the same `homeassistant` toolset the rest of
Hermes uses.

## Architecture

```
ESPHome device (Voice PE, S3-BOX, HA app Assist)
   │ ESPHome native API (HA's side)
   ▼
Home Assistant — Assist pipeline (wake, STT, TTS)
   │ Wyoming handle: per-utterance TCP connection FROM HA
   ▼
hermes gateway → plugins/platforms/ha_conversation/  (this plugin, port 10600)
   Transcript → shared "home" session → agent turn → Handled(reply)
```

Each utterance opens a **fresh TCP connection from HA**, HA sends a single
`Transcript` event, and the plugin answers with exactly one `Handled` (or
`NotHandled`) event before the connection closes — one utterance per
connection, by design of the Wyoming `handle` protocol.

## Quick start

1. Enable the block in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (uncomment/paste from
   `cli-config.yaml.example`):

   ```yaml
   ha_conversation:
     enabled: true
     bind_host: 127.0.0.1     # use your tailnet/LAN address if HA is remote
     allowed_source_ips:      # mandatory for remote binds; HA host IP/CIDR only
       - 127.0.0.1
       - ::1
     port: 10600
     ack_after_seconds: 8.0
     announce_mode: "off"     # off | last_active | default_device | broadcast
     announce_entity: ""      # e.g. assist_satellite.kitchen (default_device mode)
     max_transcript_chars: 2000
   ```

2. In Home Assistant: **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration →
   Wyoming Protocol** → host = the machine running Hermes, port = `10600`
   (or whatever you set `port` to).
3. **Settings → Voice assistants →** your pipeline **→ Conversation agent =
   "hermes"**.
4. Speak via any Assist device (Voice PE, S3-BOX, the mobile app's Assist,
   the HA dashboard mic). The reply comes back through HA's existing TTS.

If HA runs on a different machine than Hermes, set `bind_host` to a
LAN/tailnet address Hermes is reachable on (the default `127.0.0.1` only
accepts connections from the same host), replace `allowed_source_ips` with
the HA host IP or the narrowest required CIDR, and make sure the port is
reachable through any firewall between them. A non-loopback bind without a
valid source allowlist is rejected at startup.

## One shared conversation

Every room/device talks into the **same `home` gateway session** —
there is no per-satellite or per-speaker session. That's deliberate: it's
what lets you start a thought in the kitchen and finish it in the living
room. The privacy tradeoff is explicit: anything said to *any* Assist device
in the house lands in the same conversation history and context Hermes
already has for you, and one voice interrupting mid-answer from another room
shares that same turn.

## Slow turns: ack and announce modes

Some turns (tool calls, long generations) take longer than HA's pipeline
would like to wait. If a reply isn't ready after `ack_after_seconds`
(default `8.0`), the plugin answers the open connection early with a short
acknowledgement so HA doesn't time out or show an error, then keeps working
in the background and delivers the real answer per `announce_mode`. The ack
text itself is honest about where the eventual answer will surface:

| `announce_mode`   | Ack text says…                                                      | Where the late reply actually goes                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `off` (default)    | "I'm still working on that. I'll keep the answer in our conversation." | Nowhere spoken — stays in the session transcript only.                |
| `last_active`      | "I'm still working on that. I'll announce the answer when it's ready." | The satellite that most recently sent a transcript.                   |
| `default_device`   | "I'm still working on that. I'll announce the answer when it's ready." | `announce_entity` (an `assist_satellite.*` entity you configure).     |
| `broadcast`        | "I'm still working on that. I'll announce the answer when it's ready." | All Assist satellites (`assist_satellite.announce` target `all`).     |

Announcements are delivered via Home Assistant's own
`assist_satellite.announce` service call (through the `homeassistant`
toolset's REST helpers), so HA renders the TTS — this plugin never
synthesizes audio itself.

A late reply that answers a **specific question** always targets the room
that asked it, regardless of `announce_mode`'s general routing: if Room A
asked something slow and Room B asks something else in the meantime, Room
A's eventual answer only ever plays in Room A (or nowhere, under `off`), never
in Room B.

One declared design corner: this per-room targeting only applies to a slow
*voice* turn's own late reply. A background delivery that isn't tied to any
open voice turn (e.g. a cron job finishing) arriving **while a voice turn is
actively being processed** merges straight into that turn's spoken reply
instead of following `announce_mode` — the shared `home` session has no way
to distinguish "more from the same turn" from "an unrelated delivery" once a
turn window is open.

## Home control

`supports_home_control` is advertised to HA automatically — not a config
key — whenever a `HASS_TOKEN` (Long-Lived Access Token) is configured
(the same credentials the `homeassistant` platform and toolset use). The HA
instance URL comes from `HASS_URL`, defaulting to `http://homeassistant.local:8123`;
set `HASS_URL` explicitly if your instance lives elsewhere, since announce/control calls
will otherwise target that default hostname. When a token is present,
device-control intents spoken during a conversation turn ("turn off the
kitchen lights") execute through Hermes's existing `homeassistant` toolset
inside that turn, the same way they would from text chat.

## Security model

The Wyoming `handle` protocol carries **no per-speaker identity** — HA
tells this plugin what was said, not who said it. Practically:

- Anyone within microphone range of an Assist device, or with control of a
  host/network admitted by `allowed_source_ips`, is talking to your agent with
  its full toolset and conversation history, exactly as if they'd typed to it.
- The default bind is `127.0.0.1` and the default source allowlist is loopback
  only. A remote bind must explicitly list the HA host IP or a narrow CIDR;
  other TCP peers are rejected before protocol handling.
- There is **no per-utterance confirmation for destructive actions** in this
  first version — anything the agent's normal approval policy allows from
  text chat, it will also do from a spoken command reaching this port.

Treat the port the same way you'd treat physical access to your voice
hardware: don't expose it further than you'd want a guest (or a stranger on
your Wi-Fi) to be able to talk to Hermes.

## Limitations

- **No streaming replies.** The Wyoming `handle` protocol answers with one
  `Handled` event per connection — there is no partial/incremental delivery.
- **No Wyoming intent-service mode.** This plugin implements the `handle`
  (conversation-agent) role only, not a Home Assistant intent-recognition
  service.
- **English-only ack text.** The acknowledgement strings are not localized.
- **One utterance in flight per turn slot, with a queue cap.** Utterances
  are serialized behind a single turn lock; up to **8** utterances may be
  in flight at once — one actively being processed under the lock, the
  rest queued behind it — beyond that, new requests get an immediate "I'm
  handling several requests right now — try again in a moment." instead of
  queuing further.
